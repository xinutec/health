 * every one: reading a segment's effective mode, selecting the GPS fixes that
 * fall in a segment's time window, and reducing those to a centroid. Before
 * this module each pass re-implemented them inline — ~24 copies of
 * `refinedMode ?? mode` and ~8 copies of the filter+reduce — which is both
 * noise and a correctness hazard: a copy that forgets the `??` or uses the
 * wrong window boundary is a silent bug. Centralising them removes the
 * duplication and pins ONE documented convention.
 *
 * Pure; no DB, no IO.
