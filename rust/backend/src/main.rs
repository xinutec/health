//! Three subcommands:
//!
//!   check  — read the config, open the pool, and prove both against the real
//!            database. READ-ONLY, so it is safe to point at production.
//!   sync   — the port of `dist/sync.js`: Fitbit ingestion, forward then
//!            backward, for every linked user. `--forward-only` runs the
//!            forward pass alone and touches NO backfill state, which is the
//!            form that is safe to run beside the live cron.
//!   serve  — the HTTP skeleton. NOT production's server; `src/server.ts` still
//!            owns every real route.
//!
//! ⚠ `sync` NO LONGER EXITS 2. It did, and the reason it did still holds: a
//! `sync` returning 0 having done nothing shows as a healthy scheduled run while
//! data silently stops. That guard is now carried by the code rather than by the
//! stub — the run fails loudly when it cannot read its users or reach Lean, and
//! reports a spent rate budget as the ordinary ending it is.
//!
//! ⚠ IT IS NOT WIRED INTO THE CRONJOB. `health-sync` still runs `dist/sync.js`.
//! Nothing switches over until this has been run by hand against production and
//! its writes compared with the TypeScript's.
