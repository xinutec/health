//! The backend entrypoint.
//!
//! Two subcommands today:
//!
//!   check  — read the config, open the pool, and prove both against the real
//!            database. READ-ONLY, so it is safe to point at production.
//!   sync   — the port of `dist/sync.js`. NOT IMPLEMENTED, and it says so and
//!            exits non-zero rather than completing silently.
//!
//! ⚠ `sync` exiting 2 is deliberate and is not a placeholder's politeness. This
//! binary will one day be wired into the `health-sync` CronJob, and a `sync`
//! that returned 0 having done nothing would show as a healthy scheduled run
//! while data silently stopped flowing — the exact failure the TypeScript job
//! exists to prevent. An entrypoint that cannot do its job must fail.
